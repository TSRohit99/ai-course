## 🎥 AI-Created Video

**Tool Used:** [InVideo AI](https://invideo.io/)  
**Purpose:** To create a 1+ minute video that blends theory (course topics) and lab work (algorithms & games).

### ✅ Steps:
1. **Outline Preparation**
   - Decided on key points to cover: course intro, search algorithms, game-playing AI, lab projects.
2. **InVideo AI Generator**
   - Chose a fitting template from InVideo’s AI video generator.
   - Entered the major topics and rough bullet points directly into InVideo (no pre-written script).
   - Let the AI select visuals, transitions, and pacing aligned with those topics.
3. **Customization & Timing**
   - Sketched on-screen text and visuals.
   - Adjusted clip timing so the video runs just over 1 minute.
4. **Final Export**
   - Reviewed the video for clarity and flow.
   - Exported in 1080p as `ai_course_overview.mp4`.

## 📊 AI-Generated Presentation Slides

**Tools Used:**  
- [Slides AI](https://slidesai.io/) (for content & formatting)  
- **Google Slides** (for final layout & polish)  
- **ChatGPT** (for original outline before AI import)

### ✅ Steps:
1. **Slide Outline via ChatGPT**
   - Asked ChatGPT to draft 10–12 slide outlines covering theory and lab components.
2. **Slides AI Integration**
   - Pasted the outline into Slides AI.
   - Used its AI suggestions to generate slides with speaker notes, structure, and layout.
3. **Google Slides Editing**
   - Imported AI-generated slides into Google Slides.
   - Enhanced with:
     - Theme consistency
     - Visual diagrams (search trees)
     - Icons and images
4. **Final Touches**
   - Balanced theory vs. lab content.
   - Ensured readability and ended with "Future Plans" & "Conclusion”
   - Exported `.pptx` and `.pdf` versions.
