# Artificial Intelligence Course Overview

## Purpose of the Course
The primary purpose of this course was to develop familiarity with the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), including its foundational concepts, theoretical frameworks, and real-world applications. The course introduced key AI terminologies, constraint satisfaction problems, and essential problem-solving strategies. It focused on how AI works and how it can be applied effectively in various domains, such as games and real-life scenarios.
