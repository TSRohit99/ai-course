# Artificial Intelligence Course Overview

##  Purpose of the Course

The primary purpose of this course was to develop familiarity with the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), including its foundational concepts, theoretical frameworks, and real-world applications. The course introduced key AI terminologies, constraint satisfaction problems, and essential problem-solving strategies. It focused on how AI works and how it can be applied effectively in various domains, such as games and real-life scenarios.

## What I Learned from the Course

Throughout the course, I acquired knowledge in the following areas:

- **Uninformed Search Algorithms:**
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)
  - Depth-Limited Search (DLS)
  - Bidirectional Search

- **Informed Search Algorithms:**
  - Heuristic Search
  - Best-First Search
  - A* Algorithm
  - AO* Algorithm
  - Hill Climbing
  - Beam Search

- **Game Playing Algorithms:**
  - Minimax Algorithm
  - Alpha-Beta Pruning

In addition to theoretical understanding, I also implemented many of these algorithms in practical scenarios, particularly in solving problems and designing game-based AI systems like Chess, TicTacToe and Smart RPS.

## Duration of the Course

The total duration of this course was **6 months**.
